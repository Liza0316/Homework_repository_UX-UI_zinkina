# UI Design: Product Card Component

Practical work on creating a product card UI component (e-commerce) in Figma. The main focus was on using Auto Layout and typography.

## Tools
- Figma (Design, Auto Layout, Components)

## Implementation Process (Workflow)

### 1. Preparing Visual Content
- Created a main frame for the product image.
- Placed the bag image with appropriate padding to create "air" around the object.

### 2. Price & Rating Block
- Created a horizontal container (Horizontal Auto Layout).
- Key Feature: **Space Between** (Gap: Auto) distribution mode was used to align the price to the left edge and the rating stars to the right, regardless of the card width.

### 3. Typography and Hierarchy
- **Heading:** A display serif font (El Messiri) was used for the model name ("Bianco Crossbody") to create a premium look.
- **Description:** A grotesque font (El Messiri) in gray was used to reduce visual noise. The text describes key benefits (design, material, fittings).

### 4. Interactive Element (CTA Button)
- The "Buy Now" button was created using Auto Layout.
- A fixed height and rounded corners (Corner Radius) were set to match the overall style.
- A contrasting black background emphasizes the target action.

### 5. Final Assembly
- All elements (Photo, Price/Rating, Text, Button) are combined into a single vertical **Auto Layout**. - Adjusted padding within the product card to ensure neat content alignment.

## Result
A concise and functional product card, ready for use in an online store catalog.# UI Design: Product Card Component

Practical work on creating a product card UI component (e-commerce) in Figma. The main focus was on using Auto Layout and typography correctly.

## Tools
- **Figma** (Design, Auto Layout, Components)

## Implementation Process (Workflow)

### 1. Preparing Visual Content
- Created a main frame for the product image.
- Placed the bag image with appropriate padding to create "air" around the object.

### 3. Typography and Hierarchy
- **Heading:** A display serif font is used for the model name ("Bianco Crossbody") to create a premium look.
- **Description:** A sans-serif font in gray is used to reduce visual noise. The text describes key benefits (design, material, fittings).

### 4. Interactive Element (CTA Button)
- The "Buy Now" button was created using Auto Layout.
- A fixed height and rounded corners (Corner Radius) are set to match the overall style.

## Conclusion

This project reinforced our skills in interface layout in Figma using the Auto Layout tool.

Key Results:
1. Mastered working with Spacing Modes, specifically using Gap: Auto to create adaptive spacing between the price and rating.
2. A proper visual hierarchy of card elements was established.
3. A flexible component was created that maintains its structure when resized or reloaded.

This project demonstrates an understanding of modular design principles and the component's readiness for use in real projects.
