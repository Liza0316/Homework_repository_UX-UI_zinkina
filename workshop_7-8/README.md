# **Practical tasks 7–8. Typography in UI design (Parts 1–2)**

## **Work process**

These tasks were aimed at **understanding the principles of typography in digital interfaces** and applying them to create a clear, balanced layout in **Figma**.

In **Part 1**, I explored theoretical materials from  
[*Typography — Figma User Guide, sections 9–10*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IAKGCHHd1mB2Ecz_xdSHvbygmMeIOiWp-nQBAQz_JlY/edit?usp=sharing),  
to learn how **font selection, spacing, and hierarchy** affect how users perceive and read information.  

In **Part 2**, after watching the video tutorial  
[*Typography in UI Design (YouTube)*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VouVsut_-Ak),  
I created a **Figma composition themed around usability testing**, paying special attention to font scale, readability, and spacing consistency.

The structure of my layout consists of two key sections:  
- **Left sidebar** — a vertical navigation block with numbered sections and subtle background contrast;  
- **Right content area** — an article section with a highlighted quote and properly aligned text columns.  

During the process, I focused on achieving **clean typography**, consistent line rhythm, and correct use of **font weights** to improve readability and overall composition balance.

## **Conclusions**

This exercise helped me strengthen my understanding of **typography as a design tool**, not just as text styling.  
By recreating the interface in Figma, I practiced **aligning elements, setting proper spacing, combining fonts, and managing text hierarchy**.  
The final result demonstrates how thoughtful typography enhances **clarity, structure, and user experience** in any digital product.
